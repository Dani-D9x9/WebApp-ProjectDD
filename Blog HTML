                <h3>A Change is as good as a rest</h3>
                <h4>Beginner, Challenges, Learning Curve, Persistance</h4>
                <p>I've been a stagehand for the last 7 years. I've done over 300 shows and I've done lots of really cool things. Tha being said, the stagehand lifestyle takes a huge toll
on ones body and mind. Up until recently I didn't think that getting into cbyersecurity was something that was attainable for me, but I'm at a point in my career and life where I'm ready for a change. All of that is to say that cybersecurity has been a passion of mine all of my life.
<br><br>
When I was in middle school I competed in the optimist club oratorical contest and spoke about the idea of syncing ones devices to itunes and itunes storing sensitive personal data without the user knowing. In high school I did my capstone project on the hasty conception of the Patriot act and the
government and law enforcements use of its loopholes to infringe upon the rights of private citizens. The thesis was essnetially that (in 2017) the state of government internet monitoring and the creation of profiles on ordinary citizens based on their digital activity, infringes our 4th amendment rights and must be combatted. 

<br><br> 
Now that I understand a far wider range of cybersecurity concepts than when I started, I'm excited to revisit old ideas and projects and just see what I can do with my knowledge. I am also very excited to begin a new career in a fascinating anf fulfilling industry.

                <h4>Cybersecurity, Humor, Jokes </h4>
                <p>
                    Since I got all squishy in the last blog post, I thought I would fulfill a request by our TA for humor in our blog posts.
Compiled here are 5 cybersecurity  jokes I've found (paraphrased of course)
<br><br>
1) Cybersecurity is like an onion, its got lots of layers and will definietly make you want to cry.
<br><br>
2) Layer 8 is where most issues occur. There's an 8th OSI layer? Yeah, its the user...
<br><br>
3)Linux isn't real magic, its just sudo-science.
<br><br>
4) Wanna hear a UDP joke? Did you get it?
<br><br>
5) The azure user experience...
